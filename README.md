### What I learned

Although is true that, it seems, I got to the end of the challenge, I don't feel my solution is 100% correct. I still have a lot to learn, like how to reduce the amount of code or making my projects more responsive.

### Continued development

I am just starting, so I think I should work on (almost everything):

- Reducing the amount of code
- Making my projects more responsive
- Using Media queries properly

### Useful resources
